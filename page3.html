         <ul>
         <li><p>Think about where you're taking the resources from- Think clearly about where you are taking the resources from. If it is from a place with a lot of wildlife, you want to reconsider your options because those are homes of many living organisms. </p></li>
         <li><p>Be mindful with resources- Only create electronics that you need to create. Making more electronics than we need will use up a lot of resources that don't replenish itself as fast.</p></li>
         <li><p>Think before you buy- You don't need the new iPhone every year, one can last you at least 3-4. Excess buying of electronics will encourage big companies to keep making more as demand for the newest phone rolls in. </p></li>
