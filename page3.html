          <h1>Reducing Impact on the Environment</h1>
        <h3>How can we minimize the impact of computer device production on the environment?</h3>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Think about where you're taking the resources from- Think clearly about where you are taking the resources from. If it is from a place with a lot of wildlife, you want to reconsider your options because those are homes of many living organisms. </p></li>
         <li><p>Be mindful with resources- Only create electronics that you need to create. Making more electronics than we need will use up a lot of resources that don't replenish itself as fast.</p></li>
         <li><p>Think before you buy- You don't need the new iPhone every year, one can last you at least 3-4. Excess buying of electronics will encourage big companies to keep making more as demand for the newest phone rolls in. </p></li>
         </ul>
        <h3>What are some ways to reduce the environmental impact of computer use?</h3>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Spend less time on the computer- A lot of people need to use the computer, however, you don't need it on 24/7 to grind on this new game. This consumes energy, and to produce this energy could affect the environment.</p></li>
         <li><p>Electronics that use renewable energy sources- We can try to have our at home computers use a little bit of solar power, or we can try to create a iPhone with less materials. If you can, try to switch your home to use renewable power sources.</p></li>
    <h3>How can we minimize the impact of computer device disposal on the environment?</h3>
             <ul>
            <li><p>Being considerate- You don't need the new iPhone every year, one can last you at least 3-4. Excess buying of electronics even though you have one that works perfectly find will only create more e-waste with the products you don't use. Unless you're planning to give it away or passing it down, there is no use to have a new iPhone for yourself every year.</p></li>
            <li><p>Recycle properly- You can find a way to recycle your e-waste properly and environment won't be harmed as much. Make sure you're not throwing out your electronics in the trash but driving to a place where they take e-waste and dispose it correctly. We can reduce, reuse, recycle. We can learn how to reuse materials instead of just trying them out after one use. Computers can do much more than just be a waste after their done. </p></li>
