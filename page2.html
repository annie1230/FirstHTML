                <td><p>Habitat Destruction: When creating computer devices, multiple natural resources are needed. This causes humans to extract them from nature, where many living things call home. Lots of living things have their home broken or are forced to move away somewhere else because humans are extracting resources from their home to create computers.</p></td>
                <td><p>Resource use: To create computers, we need resources. We mostly use resources that we get from mining, and those resources are also used for other things too. Because we are using so many materials in such a short time, this causes a rapid depletion of natural resources. We haven't given the natural resources enough time to replenish itself, thus leaving less and less materials on earth.</p></td>
                <td><p>Energy consumption: Electronic devices need energy and power to turn on. They also require battery to keep working even after turned on. This means that they are constantly using power and energy.  This amount of energy consumption is a great amount, and currently our primary source for power is burning fossil fuels which are super bad for the environment because it heats up the atmosphere and creates global warming.</p></td>
                <td><p>Difficult to dispose: When you're done using the computers, in order to dispose your computer, you have to find a place that will take you e-waste and dispose it properly. The government will not take your e-waste if you just leave it in front of your house, you yourself have to go to a drop off place to drop your e-waste. What if there isn't a e-waste place near your home? Then it would be too difficult to dispose your waste properly. To break down all the materials used to create your electronic will also be difficult, especially trying to preserve the materials, making disposing E-waste difficult.
                     E-waste can harm our planet in so many different ways. It can release toxic fumes into the air we breathe and effect other living organisms too.</p></td>
                <td><p>Pollution: In relation to energy consumption, when this happens fossil fuels are being used which release carbon emission in the air thus global warming. </p></td>
                <td><p>Materials lost: If the e-waste isn't recycled, these materials are gone forever. Our planet only has so many materials and after we use all of them there is no more to get. </p></td>
                <td><p>Landfill overcrowding: When so many resources being used then thrown out, landfills are pilling up and growing to the point where there is no space for more garbage. This is overcrowding, which leads to negative effects on the environment. </p></td>
                <td><p>E-waste: If computer devices are not disposed properly, this can cause a lot of problems because computer are usually made with materials such as arsenic, mercury, lead, and other toxic materials. If devices are not disposed properly, these elements can contaminate our air, water, and land. </p></td>
